# AstroCookie
n-body simulator | AstroCookie is a stochastic mechanical simulator that I started coding in 2021, i have made many changes to its main body, but now I have come round again to make few more changes based on ideas I have gotten while studying for my physics BSc in my University from Milton Keynes.

This repository is mostly coded in C and Python - Yes, I did first code this in C because I chose to start learning programming from the very start of what I thought at the time, was the start of programming. (Oh, how little did I know.)
